IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Plaintiff,
v.
JOHN DOE,
Defendant.

MEMORANDUM OPINION

This matter comes before the Court on Defendant's Motion to Dismiss. After careful consideration of the parties' submissions, the relevant legal authorities, and the entire record, the Court DENIES the motion for the reasons set forth below.

I. BACKGROUND

On January 1, 2025, Defendant John Doe was charged with violating 18 U.S.C. ยง 1343 (wire fraud) and 18 U.S.C. ยง 1956 (money laundering). The indictment alleges that between March 2024 and December 2024, Defendant engaged in a scheme to defraud investors by soliciting investments in a fictitious cryptocurrency platform.

According to the Government, Defendant raised approximately $10 million from investors by falsely representing that their funds would be used to develop a revolutionary blockchain technology. Instead, the Government alleges that Defendant diverted a substantial portion of the funds for personal expenses, including the purchase of luxury vehicles, real estate, and travel.

On February 15, 2025, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Dismiss, arguing that: (1) the indictment fails to state an offense; (2) the wire fraud statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied to cryptocurrency transactions; and (3) the Government engaged in selective prosecution.

II. LEGAL STANDARD

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(3)(B)(v) permits a defendant to file a pretrial motion to dismiss an indictment for "failure to state an offense." To withstand a motion to dismiss, an indictment must "contain[] the elements of the offense charged and fairly inform[] a defendant of the charge against which he must defend." Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 117 (1974). The Court must presume the allegations in the indictment to be true. United States v. Ballestas, 795 F.3d 138, 149 (D.C. Cir. 2015).

A statute is unconstitutionally vague if it "fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes, or [is] so standardless that it invites arbitrary enforcement." Johnson v. United States, 576 U.S. 591, 595 (2015). To establish selective prosecution, a defendant must demonstrate that the prosecution "had a discriminatory effect and that it was motivated by a discriminatory purpose." United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 465 (1996).
